				<p>In order to keep SFUF as safe as possible, we want to hold everyone to the same standards. We expect active participation in taking care of one another, in doing the right thing, in making smart decisions. So much hard work has gone into making this event beautiful and comfortable, and it will take each of you to keep it up throughout the event. Thank you so much for your attendance, and...</p>
				<h2>Zero Waste</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Please respect the land at all times.</li>
					<li>Recycling centers will be provided throughout the property, and it is your responsibility to ensure that everything makes it to the designated area. We are asking you to be conscious with disposal with our new recycling / composting efforts. There are tin cans scattered as well for cigarette butts, blunt or joint roaches, and ashing bowls. Pack it in, pack it out.</li>
					<li>Power sources are extremely limited and for the use of production for the festival.</li>
					<li>This a natural area, please be very careful! Wear shoes, watch out for blackberry bushes and other painful plants, bugs, uneven ground, holes, tree roots.</li>
					<li>There are porta potties on site, available for use. Please respect that space, keeping it as clean as possible, as others will need to use them the entirety of the weekend.</li>
					<li>Pack it in, pack it out: thinking of the Quarry like you would a pristine nature reserve. The Quarriors who reside out here call this place home and worked hard to restore its natural environment. Let’s help them stay true to their goal and pack out everything you pack in.</li>
					<li>The devil is in the details: keep track of receipts, earplugs, gum wrappers, and cigarette butts. Pack them out or have a Zero Waste volunteer help you sort them into the right receptacle.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>The Quarry</h2>
				<p>We are so honored to be able to host Uprising Festival at this incredible venue. Did you know the Lookout Arts Quarry operates all year long? Did you know that people live out here? Did you know most of them are craftspeople and world-renowned circus performers?</p>
				<p>There’s more than meets the eye on this beautiful site and that includes lots of fully or partially completed projects created by the artists who live there. If you see something interesting, but it doesn’t look like it’s part of Uprising Festival, it probably isn’t! Please leave the art fixtures and makeshift shelters be. This helps keep the property intact and our patrons safe. We are visitors to people’s homes when we come for Uprising Festival. We all like to host courteous guests – pay it forward. ☺ For more information, please check out their website: <a href="https://lookoutarts.com/" target="_blank">https://lookoutarts.com/</a></p>
